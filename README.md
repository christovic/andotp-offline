### A utility to read and use decrypted backups from [https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP](andOTP) to create OTP codes without the app itself.

Adapted from Jakob's [https://github.com/andOTP/WebDecrypt](WebDecrypt) for the cryptography side of things, and Dan's [https://github.com/jaden/totp-generator](totp-generator) for the design of the site.
